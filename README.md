# COVID-19 Data Analysis with Python

Welcome to the COVID-19 Data Analysis project repository! This repository is dedicated to exploring and analyzing a mini dataset related to the COVID-19 pandemic using Python. We encourage contributions and open participation from the community to enhance this project.

## Tasks for Open Contribution

### Data Analysis Tasks
1. **Show Cases by Region:** Display the number of Confirmed, Deaths, and Recovered cases in each Region.
2. **Data Filtering:** Remove all records where the Confirmed Cases are Less Than 10.
3. **Maximum Confirmed Cases:** Identify the Region with the maximum number of Confirmed cases.
4. **Minimum Deaths Recorded:** Determine the Region with the minimum number of Deaths recorded.
5. **India's Status:** Retrieve the total Confirmed, Deaths, and Recovered cases reported from India till April 29, 2020.
6. **Sorting Data:**
   - Sort the entire dataset in ascending order based on the number of Confirmed cases.
   - Sort the entire dataset in descending order based on the number of Recovered cases.

### Python Commands Used in Analysis
- `import pandas as pd`
- `pd.read_csv()`
- `df.count()`
- `df.isnull().sum()`
- `import seaborn as sns`
- `import matplotlib.pyplot as plt`
- `sns.heatmap(df.isnull())`
- `plt.show()`
- `df.groupby('Col_name')`
- `df.sort_values(by=['Col_name'])`
- `df[df.Col_1 == 'Element1']`
